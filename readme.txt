This is a tool that I created to resize images into various resolutions. It relies on the AWS S3 service for image storage.

To start the program, locate Main. java, which is in src > main > java, and run it either in the command line or in an IDE. The program takes no input arguments, and as soon as it starts running, it will prompt the user for one of 4 services -- 1. uploading an image to the cloud, 2. downloading an image from cloud, 3. decompress an image from local drive, or 4. list objects that are currently in the bucket.

When the user chooses the 1st service, i.e., to upload an image to the cloud, they are prompted to input a path to a file that locates an image; when the user chooses the 2nd service, i.e., to download an image from the cloud, they are prompted to input the name of an image that currently exists in the cloud bucket; when the user chooses the 3rd service, they are prompted to input a path to an image that will be uploaded to the cloud bucket and then decompressed immediately to the local drive; the 4th service simply lists the available files that can be found in the cloud bucket.

When the user chooses the 2nd and 3rd options, they are subsequently prompted to input a value that allows them to choose between 5 decompression options: 1. the original file, which simply downloads the file in the cloud bucket to the local drive and renames it as original-[image name]; 2. 640x480, which downloads a copy of the original file and renames it as original-[image name] as well as a resized version of that image with a resolution of 640x480. The resized image will be named in the local drive as resized-640x480-[image name]; 3. 1024x780, which follows the same procedure as the previous option, and 4. 1600x1200, which also follows the same procedure as the previous option as well. 5. allows the user to choose a resizing option, and prompts the user to input a width and height for resizing purposes. An image of [width]x[height] will be downloaded to the local drive and named as resized-[width]x[height]-[image name].

At the end of each service, the user will be asked if they want to continue with another service, a yes or no question. If the user wishes to continue with any of the other services, they are prompted again to choose one of the 4 aforementioned services. If not, the program ends.
